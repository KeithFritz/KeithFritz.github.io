					<h4>Wombot</h4>
					<img class="image fit main center" src="images/WombotTest.gif" alt=""
						style="float:left;width:125px;height:150px;" />
					<p>Wombot is an oil and gas tank inspection robot. This robot's purpose is to magnetically drive
						along the inside of tank walls and
						inspect the tank seal for any damage or other issues. This robot was developed along with a
						group in the Nuclear Robotics Lab (NRG)
						at UT Austin which grew into the startup company Pike Robotics. Throughout my involvment with
						this project, I was responsible
						for a number of hardware designs including the magnetic wheels, a sensor aparatus, general
						component design and layout, as well as
						in person testing and failure analysis at an oil and gas facility in Oklahoma.
					</p>

					<p>
						Throughout the development of Wombot, I gained significant experience in design and redesign of
						components for manufacturability, simplicity, and robustness.
						I used my knowledge of components and manufacturing to aid in the selection of many of the parts
						on the robot including motors, sensors, and build materials.
						I also gained experience in the design of custom components for specific applications. This
						included the design of the magnetic wheels, the sensor aparatus, and the shell.
						Additionally, I was able to work on the process of preparing the cabin for safety pressurization
						to meet strict codes for inspection devices.
					</p>

					<h4>Cobot</h4>
					<p>The Cobot robot is a custom omnidirectional robot platform. The Cobot is used for research on
						localization,
						perception, and human interaction in indoor environments at UT. It is equipped with a depth
						sensor,
						a monocular camera, a 2d LiDAR scanner, an onboard laptop with a graphical user interface for
						human interaction.
					</p>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/CobotCollage.JPG" alt="" /></a>
					<p>My role in the Cobot was primarily upgrades to the electrical systems as well as adding aditional
						capabilities,
						such as adding a robot arm in the form of a Kinova Gen3. This process involved the design
						of the physical mounting hardware, the redesign of the electrical system to compensate for the
						additional power requirement,
						and manufacturing all of the necesary additional components.

					</p>

					<h4>BWI Bots</h4>
					<p>The BWI bots are a series of robot platforms built on top of the Stanley Robotics Segway RMP
						units. These robots are primarily
						used for research in hallway navigation, human-robot-interraction, and service robotics. The BWI
						bots are equipped with a suite of
						sensors including a 2d LiDAR scanner, a 3d LiDAR scanner, and a depth camera.
					</p>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/BWICollage.JPG" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The purpose of the BWI bots is primarily for hallway navigation, so throughout my time with the
						associated lab, I worked
						to run the BWI bots throughout the building hallway autonomously while avoiding passerby people
						and other robots. These robots
						were often demonstrated when visitors came to the lab as they would be able to run for long
						amounts of time without issue. My contribution
						to this project helped to maintain the long-term goal of "living with robots" and having robots
						that can operate in human environments.
						I also did work to improve and maintain hardware systems on the robots throughout my time
						working with them.
					</p>

					<h4>Pond Hopper</h4>
					<p>The Pond Hopper was a semi-autonomous drone that my Senior Capstone team designed and built while
						I was at Texas A&M.
						This drone was designed to be able to take off and land on water, as well as be able to navigate
						autonomously to a set of GPS coordinates.
						Additionally, once the drone landed in a body of water, it would take a series of measurements
						and samples of the water
						for the purpose of testing for mosquito larvae and breeding conditions in a given body of water.
					</p>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/PondHopperCollage.JPG" alt="" /></a>
					<p>For this project, I served as the Project Manager of my team. This role meant I had a strong
						understanding of various aspects of the
						robot including software, mechanical, and electrical design. I was also responsible for the
						presentation of our project and maintaining
						a strong communicative relationship with our sponsor and client. This experience taught me alot
						about the importance of communication
						as well as time and project management in a professional environment.
					</p>

					<h3>Work with Existing Robot Platforms</h3>
					<p>In addition to my efforts in developing custom robots, I have also had significant experience
						with existing robot platforms.
						Many of these platforms come in a working state, but require additional work to be done to make
						them suitable for research purposes.
						Often times, the requirements for a robot might even change over time so further hardware and
						software modifications must be made
						for them to continue to be useful for research.
					</p>

					<h4>Boston Dynamics Spot</h4>
					<p>One of the existing platforms that I have worked with is Boston Dynamics' Spot quadraped robot.
						The Spot quadraped is used for research on campus-scale long-term autonomy at UT.
						It is equipped with LIDAR, a multi-directional suite of cameras, and is able to traverse terrain
						that is probitive to wheeled robots.</p>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/SpotCollage.JPG" alt="" /></a>
					<p>My involvment in the Spot was primarily in designing and integrating the sensor and compute suite
						located on the back of the Spot.
						I also assisted researchers in calibrating sensors and running demonstrations for visitors when
						they came to visit the facilities.
						Additionally, I have helped multiple other Spot users across research groups and universities to
						mimic the sensor suite that I developed for their own research purposes.
						Through my work with Spot I gained experience in efficient sensor integration, designing of
						hardware for research experiments, and
						long-distance design collaboration and communication.
					</p>

					<h4>Clearpath Husky and Jackal</h4>
					<p>Other existing platforms I have worked with are the Clearpath Husky and the Clearpath Jackal.
						Both of these robots are
						4-wheeled rugged driving platforms that are used for research on campus-scale long-term autonomy
						at UT. The Husky is a larger
						robot that is able to carry a more signifcant payload and drive over rougher terrain. The Jackal
						is smaller and is able to drive
						faster and more precisely than the Husky. Both robots are equipped with LIDAR, a
						multi-directional suite of cameras, as well as GPS and IMU units for campus-scale navigation.
					</p>
					</p>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/ClearpathCollage.JPG" alt="" /></a>
					<p>My work on these platforms primarily consited of adding and adjusting the sensor suites, making
						hardware modifications for various research projects,
						and performing routine maintenance and repairs. I also assisted researchers in calibrating
						sensors and running demonstrations for visitors when they came to visit the facilities.
					</p>

					<h3>Rapid Fabrication and Shop Management</h3>
					<p>At Texas Robotics, I was also responsible for the operation, training, and maintenance associated
						with a Rapid Prototyping lab, a Machine Shop, and an Electronics Shop.
						These shops hosted many different users throughout my time at UT, and I was responsible for
						ensuring that all users were properly trained and
						that all machines were properly maintained. I also worked to develop and implement new training
						procedures and safety protocols for the shops.
					</p>

					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/ShopsCollage.JPG" alt="" /></a>

					<h3>Shop Experience</h3>
