								<h3>Travel and Enjoy Life</h3>
								<p>When I can, I love to travel. Engaging with diverse cultures and connecting with people from different backgrounds 
									enriches my travel experiences, leaving me with profound insights and cherished memories. While I do enjoy eating new foods wherever I go, 
									my true passion lies in the exploration of new landscapes, engaging in thrilling activities, and creating unforgettable moments with friends.
									I love to learn about all the world has to offer and broaden my horizons as much as I can. 
									</p>
								<p></p>

								<h3>Making</h3>
								<p>In my personal time, I still love making things. Generally, that takes the form of making things out of wood
									from building a desk for my house to making a cutting board for a friend. I love the process of taking something
									in a raw form and turning it into something useful and beautiful. I also love the process of learning new skills
									which is why I try to learn something new everything I make something. I find that this love for learning and making
									has been especially useful in my career as an engineer. I am always looking for new ways to solve problems and 
									learn new skills to help me do that.
